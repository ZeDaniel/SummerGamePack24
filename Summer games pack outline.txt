Summer Games Pack Outline:

Create starting hub:
--First person hub world with teleporter gates (to the games)
--Pause menu with a quit to desktop button
--Ensure all files have unique names; no template names

Migrate required game assets one game at a time
--Basically port one game at a time
--Ensure that all the games code files are prefixed with the game title
to avoid conflicts
--Disable legacy input
--Add teleporter gate and description for the game (mario painting image?)
--Include the level in the packaged build lmao
--Test that it works!
--Repeate for next game

Roller:
-Update level references in the code for Roller
-->Update exit button of pause menu to load hub world
-->We good????

Ballem:
-Get C++ code over
--Copy files
--Generate visual studio files
--Replace API names
--Resolve conflicts
-We good

ThePunch:
-Add portal
-We good

-->Create portal to Ballem in hub world

Safety:
--Confirm changes to safety for migration
-->Save changes to safety into their own branch on github
In SGP
-->make projectile destroy things
-->Commit basic import
loop rifle animations
-->Make changes to safety animations and grip point to work more like Safety
---->Cause it only worked before with the broken skeleton
-->Update safety quit function to go to hub world
-->In pause menu and continue button
improve continue button hit box
-->Add hub world portal
-->Re-organize files (PRAY)
Safety teleporter reloads hub world level in pacakaged game
-->Test all games

Does pause menu reappear after trading safety for risk?

ToKiller:
Make changes to eliminate dupe names in a branch pre-migrate
->Do any c++ files and c++ references pre-migrate as well, since that was a pain
-->Resave and remove redirects in SGP24
---->Do other games before adding ToKiller?
update quit to open hub world
darken visibility fields
add teleporter and level preview

Decoherence:
-Do we need pickup and weapon?
-->If not, then don't port over
-->If yes, then change the OnPickup function name
-override map gamemode
-rename shit
-->When levels are renamed, add name to gates
-Rename character log from the template thing in the decoherencecharacter c++
-commit to migration branch
-c++ files
-migrate assets
-test game in sgp
-resave and remove redirects
-re-organize
-change quit to return to hub world instead
-add level gate and preview to hub world

SummerGamePack24:
Make tokiller ai not DO THAT (shoot so much when breaking LOS)
lmaooo gotta fix that windowed/fullscreen thing with thepunch
-->Render settings? Resolution maybe?
widget didn't show at end of ballem?
-->Just showed next level
add pause and quit to summer game pack
fix mouse focus between games (going back to hub world and pause menu)
-->Check within games too (Safety at least didn't work)
-->ToKiller SUPER breaks mouse input
---->PROBABLY best to just set manually the input mode when loading hub world gamemode
----->YES, actually
bug:quitting roller in level transition will reload you into roller
-->Edit game instance/quit function to take account for this
add at least a little text to each portal
--Show prompt for the game

Add plaque section detailing scope, timelines, and takeaways/dev acoomplishments
-->Like the evaluation/reflection doc

Add bonus plaque for "Keep Growing"
-Sub-Plaques for each game, describe differences before and after

Add dev/interview mode to the hub world.
-->Toggle with button in middle. Tie to instance variable so they're
still there when returning to the hub world


Notes:

For C++ code:
-Copy + paste the files, do not copy over ballem.h, or ballem build/target files only the game files
-Delete saved and intermediate, generate project files
-Replace API names in files
-Create core redirects in DefaultEngine.ini
-Migrate Blueprints (test ONE first)
-->Check gamemode c++ file for default pawn code(maybe try removing it? otherwise update it)
